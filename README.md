# TouchFarm
Open source DofusTouch Lindo edition farming bot

Hey guys, HoPollo here, I'm a beginner in AutoIt & programming in general, and like to mess around with games I play to make a fun way to learn programming.  

Today i'm sharing a quick project with you guys. The goal is not to blindly download, use & complain about it ! But to improves it together, in any case you will have to adjust settings/images for your own !  

So, let me know about all your suggestions or more & let's make that super smart step by step.
